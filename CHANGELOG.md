# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.10.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- JSON file-system persistence layer (TR6) at `/db` folder
- Repository pattern with `JsonRepository` for data access abstraction
- File I/O utilities with atomic write pattern (temp file + rename) to prevent corruption
- Seed data support: `db/seed/activities.json` with 4 predefined activities
- Centralized data loader (`data-loader.ts`) that loads seed and persisted data on startup
- Automatic directory creation for `db/` and `db/seed/` folders
- Data persistence for all entities: activities, users, bookings, payments

### Changed
- All services (ActivityService, UserService, BookingService, PaymentService) now use JSON repositories instead of in-memory Maps
- Services maintain backward compatibility with optional repository injection
- Data persists across server restarts
- Seed data loads on startup and merges with persisted data (persisted takes precedence)
- UserService maintains emailIndex Map for fast email lookups while using repository for persistence

### Technical
- Introduced repository layer (`src/repositories/`) separating data access from business logic
- All entity data stored in JSON files: `db/activities.json`, `db/users.json`, `db/bookings.json`, `db/payments.json`
- Seed files are read-only; runtime writes only go to entity files in `db/`
- Graceful handling of missing files (creates empty arrays, creates directories as needed)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests from other ports
- `cors` package dependency for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

## [1.9.0] - 2026-01-26

### Changed
- Authentication endpoints restructured for better RESTful design
- `POST /auth/register` moved to `POST /users` for user registration
- `POST /auth/login` moved to `POST /login` for user authentication
- Created separate `users.ts` route file for user management
- Updated `auth.ts` to only handle login functionality

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with new endpoint paths
- Updated user authentication specification to reflect new endpoints

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- Query parameter support for `GET /bookings` endpoint
- `activityId` parameter: Filter bookings by activity ID for the authenticated user

### Changed
- `GET /bookings` now supports optional `activityId` query parameter while maintaining backward compatibility (no params = returns all user bookings)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- Query parameter support for `GET /activities` endpoint
- `q` parameter: Search term that searches across activity name, location, and slug fields
- `slug` parameter: Filter activities by exact slug match
- `_sort` parameter: Sort activities by any field (e.g., 'id', 'name', 'date', 'price')
- `_order` parameter: Sort order ('asc' or 'desc', defaults to 'asc')
- `ActivityService.query()` method for filtering, searching, and sorting activities
- Support for sorting by date strings, numbers, and strings with proper type handling

### Changed
- `GET /activities` now supports query parameters while maintaining backward compatibility (no params = returns all activities)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Payment processing (FR5): automatic billing on booking creation via mock gateway
- Payment types (`Payment`, `PaymentStatus`, `MockPaymentGatewayAdapter`, `ChargeContext`, `ChargeResult`)
- Mock payment gateway (`MockPaymentGateway`) with deterministic failure (amount divisible by 1000)
- `PaymentService` with `createForBooking`, in-memory payment storage
- `paymentId` and `paymentStatus` on `Booking` and booking responses
- HTTP 402 Payment Required when mock gateway rejects charge (no booking created)

### Changed
- `POST /bookings` charges user before creating booking; 201 response includes `paymentId` and `paymentStatus`
- `BookingService.create` integrates `PaymentService`; payment failure returns 402

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Booking retrieval endpoints (`GET /bookings`, `GET /bookings/:id`)
- BookingResponse type with enriched booking data including activity information
- PaymentStatus type (pending, paid, refunded) as placeholder for FR5
- `getAllByUserId` method to retrieve all bookings for a user
- `getById` and `getUserBookingById` methods for booking retrieval
- `enrichBookingWithActivity` method to add activity details to booking responses
- `enrichBookingWithPaymentStatus` method (placeholder for payment integration)
- User authorization validation for booking retrieval (users can only access their own bookings)
- Security: unauthorized booking access returns 404 (not 403) to prevent information disclosure

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Booking creation endpoint (`POST /bookings`)
- Booking service with capacity validation
- Booking type definitions (Booking, CreateBookingRequest)
- Capacity calculation logic to prevent overbooking
- Validation for booking requests (activityId, participants)
- Error handling for capacity exceeded scenarios
- Activity existence validation before booking creation

### Changed
- Updated application to include bookings router

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Activity status lifecycle management endpoint (`PATCH /activities/:id/status`)
- Status transition validation logic with controlled lifecycle rules
- `getValidTransitions` method to retrieve allowed next statuses
- `isValidStatusTransition` method to validate status transitions
- `transitionStatus` method for controlled status updates
- Status transition validation: draft → published → confirmed → done/cancelled
- Support for sold-out status transitions (published ↔ sold-out ↔ confirmed)
- Terminal state enforcement (done and cancelled cannot transition to other statuses)

### Changed
- Updated activity update validation to prevent direct status changes via PUT endpoint
- Status changes must now go through dedicated PATCH /activities/:id/status endpoint

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Activity management endpoints (`POST /activities`, `GET /activities`, `GET /activities/:id`, `PUT /activities/:id`, `DELETE /activities/:id`)
- Activity service with full CRUD operations
- Activity type definitions with ActivityStatus
- Activity creation with automatic slug generation
- Activity ownership validation for update and delete operations
- Input validation for activity creation and updates
- Date validation (must be in the future)
- Participant threshold validation (minParticipants <= maxParticipants)
- Price and duration validation (must be positive numbers)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-25

- Email uniqueness validation during registration
- Password validation (minimum 6 characters)
- Terms acceptance validation

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- Express application entry point (`src/index.ts`)
- Health check endpoint at `/health`
- Root endpoint at `/` returning API status
- Logger utility for application logging
- Development server using `tsx` for direct TypeScript execution
- Production build configuration using TypeScript compiler
- Environment variable support for port configuration (defaults to 3000)
